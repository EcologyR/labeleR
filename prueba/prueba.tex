% List authors by first name or initial followed by last name and

Suggested section heads

\section{Introduction}

The main text should start with an introduction. Except for short
manuscripts (such as comments and replies), the text should be divided
into sections, each with its own heading.

Headings should be sentence fragments and do not begin with a lowercase
letter or number. Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are three or fewer
letters).

\section{Materials and Methods}

Here is text on Materials and Methods.

Do not use bulleted lists; enumerated lists are okay. Use \#. for list
for a cleaner LaTeX output.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  First element
\item
  Second element
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A descriptive heading about methods}

Please use ONLY \textbackslash citet and \textbackslash citep for
reference citations. DO NOT use other cite commands (e.g.,
\textbackslash cite, \textbackslash citeyear, \textbackslash nocite,
\textbackslash citealp, etc.). Example \textbackslash citet and
\textbackslash citep: \ldots as shown by \citet{Levitus2012},
\citet{Nuncio2011} and \citet{Raphael2004} \ldots as shown by
\citep{Levitus2012}, \citep{Nuncio2011}, \citep{Raphael2004}. \ldots has
been shown \citep[e.g.,][]{Levitus2012, Nuncio2011, Raphael2004}.

\section{Data}

Or section title might be a descriptive heading about data

As of 2018 we recommend use of the TrackChanges package to mark
revisions. The trackchanges package adds five new LaTeX commands:

\textbackslash note{[}editor{]}\{The note\}

\textbackslash annote{[}editor{]}\{Text to annotate\}\{The note\}

\textbackslash add{[}editor{]}\{Text to add\}

\textbackslash remove{[}editor{]}\{Text to remove\}

\textbackslash change{[}editor{]}\{Text to remove\}\{Text to add\}

complete documentation is here: http://trackchanges.sourceforge.net/

\section{Results}

Or section title might be a descriptive heading about the results

Enter Figures and Tables near as possible to where they are first
mentioned: DO NOT USE \textbackslash psfrag or \textbackslash subfigure
commands. DO NOT USE \textbackslash newcommand,
\textbackslash renewcommand, or \textbackslash def, etc.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics{prueba_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1} \caption{Please caption every figure}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}
\end{figure}

Example table

\begin{table}
 \caption{Time of the Transition Between Phase 1 and Phase 2$^{a}$}
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{l c}
 \hline
  Run  & Time (min)  \\
 \hline
   $l1$  & 260   \\
   $l2$  & 300   \\
   $l3$  & 340   \\
   $h1$  & 270   \\
   $h2$  & 250   \\
   $h3$  & 380   \\
   $r1$  & 370   \\
   $r2$  & 390   \\
 \hline
 \multicolumn{2}{l}{$^{a}$Footnote text here.}
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

AGU prefers the use of \{sidewaystable\} over \{landscapetable\} as it
causes fewer problems.

\begin{sidewaysfigure}[h]
\includegraphics{prueba_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1} \caption{Please caption every figure}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-3}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\begin{sidewaystable}
\caption{Caption here}
\label{tab:signif_gap_clos}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
one&two&three\\
four&five&six
\end{tabular}
\end{sidewaystable}

If using numbered lines, please surround equations with
\textbackslash begin\{linenomath*\}\ldots{}
\textbackslash end\{linenomath*\}

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
y|{f} \sim g(m, \sigma)
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Equation in German-born physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special
relativity that showed that the increased relativistic mass ($m$) of a
body comes from the energy of motion of the body—that is, its kinetic
energy ($E$)—divided by the speed of light squared ($c^2$).
