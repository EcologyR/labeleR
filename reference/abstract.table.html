<table class="table table"><tr><td>abstract_title</td><td>authors</td><td>affiliation</td><td>abstract_text</td></tr><tr><td>New Progress in Healing Potions, A Magical Alternative to Muggle Medicine</td><td>Severus Snape(1,2,*); Poppy Pomfrey(3); Dilys Derwent(3,4)</td><td>1. Hogwarts, United Kingdom; 2. Potion Masters’ Guild, United Kingdom; 3. St. Mungo's Hospital, United Kingdom; 4. Independent Laboratory, Wales; *corresponding author</td><td>This paper presents groundbreaking research on advanced healing potions, highlighting their effectiveness compared to conventional Muggle treatments. The authors have developed an improved version of the Bone Regeneration Potion, reducing recovery time by 40%. Additionally, the study explores new applications of the Mental Soothing Potion, specifically in reducing post-traumatic stress in victims of magical accidents. The research involved a thorough analysis of rare ingredients, such as powdered Erumpent horn, and safer brewing techniques to avoid common side effects. The results have been tested on volunteers at St. Mungo's Hospital with remarkable success, suggesting that potions may play a critical role in the future of magical medicine. These findings are expected to encourage greater collaboration between the magical community and public magical healthcare on an international level.</td></tr><tr><td>Advances in Magical Creature Protection: A New Approach to Hippogriff Conservation</td><td>Newt Scamander(1,2);Rubeus Hagrid(3,*)</td><td>1. Magical Congress of the United States of America, Department for the Regulation of Magical Creatures, USA; 2. Magizoological Society of America, United States; 3. Hogwarts, United Kingdom; *corresponding author</td><td>Our innovative study delves into current efforts to protect and preserve hippogriffs, magical creatures endangered by illegal hunting and habitat loss. The research team, led by Hagrid and Scamander, has developed a new conservation strategy based on non-invasive magical tracking spells to monitor these creatures. The study also provides recommendations for creating magical sanctuaries in rural areas of Europe, where hippogriffs can live undisturbed by human activity. Additionally, advances in captive breeding programs ensure the safety and well-being of these creatures. Implementation of these methods has begun in France and Scotland, showing promising results, and these practices are expected to expand globally in the coming years. This research emphasizes the importance of balancing magic with environmental protection to ensure the survival of magical species.</td></tr><tr><td>The Ethical Use of Legilimency, Where Should the Limits Be Drawn?</td><td>Albus Dumbledore(1,2,3,*); Emmeline Vance(3,4); Hermione Granger(1)</td><td>1. Hogwarts, United Kingdom; 2. International Confederation of Wizards; 3. Order of the Phoenix, United Kingdom; 4. Ministry of Magic, Department of Magical Law, Australia; *corresponding author</td><td>This article tackles the controversial topic of Legilimency, the magic used to penetrate others’ minds, and discusses the ethical implications of its use. While Legilimency can be a powerful tool for gathering information and strengthening magical defense, it also raises concerns about privacy and consent. The paper explores several recent legal cases where Legilimency was used without the victim’s knowledge or approval, proposing the establishment of international regulations that restrict its use to extreme situations, such as high-risk criminal investigations. The authors also examine alternative methods for obtaining information through magic, arguing that increased oversight and training in this field are essential to preventing abuses of power. The article concludes with a reflection on the importance of setting clear boundaries to ensure that magical practices do not infringe upon fundamental rights.</td></tr><tr><td>The Influence of Dark Magic on Contemporary Magical Arts</td><td>Bellatrix Lestrange(1,2); Fenrir Greyback(3); Draco Malfoy(2,*)</td><td>1. Death Eaters, United Kingdom; 2. Dark Arts Society, Eastern Europe; 3. Independent, United Kingdom; *corresponding author</td><td>Here we examine the growing influence of Dark Magic on contemporary magical arts, focusing on its cultural and social impact. Over the past few decades, Dark Magic has gained popularity in certain artistic circles, where it has been used as a source of inspiration for new forms of magical expression. The authors, coming from different backgrounds, present an analysis of how this influence has permeated the creation of innovative spells, experimental potions, and magical artifacts. While some advocates argue that Dark Magic can be used in a controlled manner to achieve magical breakthroughs, others warn of the inherent dangers of such practices. The paper also explores the controversy surrounding the display of Dark Magic-related objects in magical museums and galleries. Madame Maxime offers a critical perspective on the importance of educating young wizards about the risks of normalizing these practices, while Lestrange and Greyback defend the right of wizards to explore all aspects of magic, including the darker ones.</td></tr><tr><td>Wandlore and Its Impact on Spellcasting Efficiency: A Comparative Study</td><td>Garrick Ollivander(1,*); Albus Dumbledore(2,3); Fleur Delacour(4)</td><td>1. Ollivanders Wand Shop, United Kingdom; 2. Hogwarts, United Kingdom; 3. International Confederation of Wizards; 4. Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, France; *corresponding author</td><td>To study the relationship between wand materials and spellcasting efficiency, we focused on how different wand cores and woods affect magical output. Ollivander, Dumbledore, and Delacour conducted controlled experiments on various wands, comparing the responsiveness and power of spells cast with phoenix feather, dragon heartstring, and unicorn hair cores. The research also delves into the importance of wand length and flexibility in determining a witch or wizard's compatibility with their wand. Using data collected from students at Beauxbatons and Hogwarts, the authors identify clear trends in wand performance and propose recommendations for future wandlore developments. This study provides important insights for wandmakers and is expected to influence future innovations in wand crafting.</td></tr><tr><td>Magical Plants and Their Role in Potion Brewing: Discovering New Ingredients</td><td>Pomona Sprout(1,*); Severus Snape(1,2); Neville Longbottom(1)</td><td>1. Hogwarts, United Kingdom; 2. Potion Masters’ Guild, United Kingdom; *corresponding author</td><td>This paper investigates the discovery of new magical plants and their potential use in potion brewing. Professor Pomona Sprout and her colleagues, Snape and Longbottom, have identified several rare plants from the Forbidden Forest that possess unique magical properties. Through meticulous study and experimentation, they have developed new potions that enhance magical abilities, improve healing rates, and provide temporary resistance to curses. In this research, the authors discuss the careful cultivation of these plants and the challenges associated with their use. The paper emphasizes the importance of ethical harvesting and sustainability to ensure these plants continue to thrive for future generations. The findings are expected to impact the field of potion making significantly, with implications for both medical and practical magical applications.</td></tr><tr><td>The Role of the Patronus Charm in Combatting Dark Creatures: A Defensive Approach</td><td>Remus Lupin(1,*); Kingsley Shacklebolt(1,2); Alastor Moody(1,3)</td><td>1. Order of the Phoenix, United Kingdom; 2. Ministry of Magic, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, United Kingdom; 3. Auror Office, United Kingdom; *corresponding author</td><td>In our paper we present an in-depth analysis of the Patronus Charm and its effectiveness in protecting witches and wizards from Dark creatures, particularly Dementors and Lethifolds. The study, led by Remus Lupin, a former Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, highlights the importance of strong positive memories in casting an effective Patronus. Additionally, the authors have developed new defensive techniques that combine Patronus-based shields with advanced Auror training. Shacklebolt and Moody provide firsthand insights into the application of these techniques during high-risk field operations. The paper includes practical advice for Aurors and magical law enforcement on improving their Patronus Charms and optimizing their use in battle. This research is expected to significantly enhance the magical community's ability to defend against dark threats.</td></tr><tr><td>Time-Turners and Temporal Ethics: Should the Laws Be Reconsidered?</td><td>Hermione Granger(1,*); Amelia Bones(2)</td><td>1. Hogwarts, United Kingdom; 2. Wizengamot, United Kingdom; *corresponding author</td><td>It is now the moment to revise the ethical concerns surrounding the use of Time-Turners, questioning whether current laws governing temporal magic are still relevant. Hermione Granger, alongside Dumbledore and Bones, argues that while Time-Turners are highly regulated due to the dangers of time manipulation, there may be legitimate uses for them in controlled settings, such as for educational purposes or critical historical research. The authors review several case studies where temporal magic was involved, including past incidents where Time-Turners were used to save lives. However, they also acknowledge the catastrophic potential for abuse. The paper concludes with recommendations for updated legal frameworks that balance the potential benefits and risks of time travel, ensuring ethical use without compromising the fabric of time itself.</td></tr></table></div>
