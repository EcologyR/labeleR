}
\details{
\strong{font}
Not all fonts can be used. Consider only those which are stated to be 'Part of TeX Live',
and have OTF and TT available. Additionally, fonts whose 'Usage' differs from
\verb{\\normalfont}, \verb{\\itshape} and \verb{\\bfseries} usually fail during installation and/or rendering.

Several fonts tried that seem to work are:
\itemize{
\item libertinus
\item accanthis
\item Alegreya
\item algolrevived
\item almendra
\item antpolt
\item Archivo
\item Baskervaldx
\item bitter
\item tgbonum
\item caladea
\item librecaslon
\item tgchorus
\item cyklop
\item forum
\item imfellEnglish
\item LobsterTwo
\item quattrocento
}
